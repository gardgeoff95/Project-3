# **ecobourne** 
### A Life Cycle Simulation
***
#### How does it work?
**ecobourne** is a game built with Electron to simulate the life cycle of animals in a controlled, yet evolving ecosystem. The environment is dynamically built using random variables to introduce a new experience each and every simulation that's run.

#### How do I play?
To play **ecobourne** simply create an account, and join a game lobby. Joining a lobby will display your username along with every other user currently attending the active game. 

You will have access at all times to the **ecobourne** game tracker to stay up to date with how the current environment is changing. There are many possibilities with each iteration of the simulation, and more even [more features to come!](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=this+is+a+template+link+to+show+some+future+features+of+ecobourne!)

Once the simulation has completed, you will be able to view all game data from the most recent simulation you were apart of!
